Split cp4ker.hex into two files:
         f1.hex
         f2.hex
download files to osborne:
PIP F1.HEX=PTR:
^Z
PIP F2.HEX=PTR
^Z
combine files:
PIP CP4KER.HEX=F1.HEX,F2.HEX
download cp4osb.hex to osborne:
PIP CP4OSB.HEX=PTR:
^z

Creating a run-able Kermit from the distribution kit:

	A>ddt cp4ker.hex
	NEXT  PC
	3500 0100
	-icp4osb.hex
	-r
	NEXT  PC
	xxxx 0000
	-^C
	A>save dd kermit40.com

The page count ("dd") used in the SAVE command is calculated from the last
address ("xxxx") given by DDT in response to the R command:  divide this
number by 100 hex, rounding up, then convert to decimal:  384F becomes 39
hex, which is 57 decimal; but 3700 becomes 37 hex, or 55 decimal.
Be careful not to overwrite your running Kermit, if any, with this new
version until you've tested it. (I used 59 for dd)


Test your new Kermit by running it.  If it gives you a prompt, it might be
OK. (don't delete your old one yet...).  Instead of a prompt, you could get
one of two messages indicating that the configuration information is invalid:
    ?Kermit has not been configured for a target system
	or
    ?Consistency check on configuration failed
Of course, neither of these messages should appear if you're building Kermit
from the distribution kit.  The first message indicates that the overlay was
not found where the system-independent module expected to find it, probably
because the overlay address is incorrect; the second indicates that the version
of CP4LNK used in the system-dependent module is incompatible with the system-
independent module.
